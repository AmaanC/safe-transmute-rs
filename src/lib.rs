//! This crate contains checked implementations of `transmute()`.
//!
//! The functions in this crate are not inherently safe, but just guarded against common simple mistakes
//! (like trying to create an 8-byte type from 7 bytes).
//!
//! Those functions are exactly as safe as the data passed to them - creating a null pointer,
//! for example, is not unsafe in and of itself, but dereferencing it certainly *is*,
//! but they don't do that (see [here](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/safe-transmute-rs/issues/1)
//! for extended discussion).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! View bytes as a series of `u16`s:
//!
//! ```
//! # use safe_transmute::guarded_transmute_many;
//! # unsafe {
//! assert_eq!(guarded_transmute_many::<u16>(&[0x00, 0x01,
//!                                            0x12, 0x34,
//!                                            // Spare byte, unused
//!                                            0x00]),
//!            &[0x0100, 0x3412]);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! View bytes as an `f64`:
//!
//! ```
//! # use safe_transmute::guarded_transmute;
//! # unsafe {
//! assert_eq!(guarded_transmute::<f64>(&[0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]),
//!            0.0);
//! # }
//! ```
