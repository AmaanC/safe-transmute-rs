//! Plain data object safe transmute
//!
//! Functions in this module are guarded from out-of-bounds memory access and
//! from unsafe transmutation target types through the use of the
//! [`PodTransmutable`](trait.PodTransmutable.html)) trait.
//! 
//! However, they are still not entirely safe because the source data may not
//! be correctly aligned for reading and writing a value of the target type.
//! The effects of this range from less performance (e.g. x86) to trapping or
//! address flooring (e.g. ARM), but this is undefined behavior nonetheless.

/// Type that can be non-`unsafe`ly transmuted into
///
/// A type `T` implementing this trait means that any arbitrary slice of bytes
/// of length `size_of::<T>()` can be safely interpreted as a value of that
/// type in all circumstances. In most cases this is a
/// [*POD class*](http://eel.is/c++draft/class#10) or a
/// [*trivially copyable class*](http://eel.is/c++draft/class#6).
///
/// This serves as a marker trait for all functions in this module.
///
/// *Warning*: if you transmute into a floating-point type you will have a chance to create a signaling NaN,
/// which, while not illegal, can be unwieldy. Check out [`util::designalise_f{32,64}()`](util/index.html)
/// for a remedy.
///
/// *Nota bene*: `bool` is not `PodTransmutable` because they're restricted to
/// being `0` or `1`, which means that an additional value check is required.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// It is only safe to implement `PodTransmutable` for a type `T` if it is safe for a slice of any arbitrary data
/// `&[u8]` of length `sizeof<T>()` to be [`transmute()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.transmute.html)d
/// to a unit-length `&[T]`, without any other conversion operation being required.
